#####Note:
Facebook posting requires "publish_actions" to be approved in your facebook application. Do not enable facebook posting until and unless you have "publish_actions" approved before enabling it. If not, then the plugin would generate a redirect loop error as it won't be able to get "publish_actions" as approved API when pulling user data at the time of login/registration.
